Theoretical Distributed
-----------------------

This contains examples of distributed algorithms I implemented in Go. The algorithms are taken from [this book](https://a8779-2401331.cluster15.canvas-user-content.com/courses/8779~17212/files/8779~2401331/course%20files/Introduction%20to%20Reliable%20and%20Secure%20Distributed%20Second%20Edition%202.pdf?download_frd=1) (download link) which is the main reading for our Algorithms, Model and Concepts in Distributed Systems course.

Warning: this folder contains some quite formal and mathematical stuff.
